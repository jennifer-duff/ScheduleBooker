## USAGE
To run the program, simply open the application and login. The app will pull from the SQL database to display appointments,
contacts, customers, reports, and more.

The app consists of three main tabs: "Appointments," "Customers," and "Reports":

- The "Appointments" tab displays all current appointments, and can be broken down by week or month if desired. This is also where users can add, update, or delete appointments as needed.

- The "Customers" tab displays all current customers and their information (name, address, ID, etc.). This is also where users can add, update, or delete customers as needed. NOTE: deleting a customer will also delete all of the customer's active appointments, if any exist.

- The "Reports" tab displays reports on the number and of appointments by type and by month, and also shows schedules for each contact and customer.
